## Description ‚úÖ

_This is a program for users to catalog things they need for upcoming camping, backpacking, bike touring, road trips, or other types of travel. This program allowed us to practice making MVC apps that use RESTfully named routes and include CRUD functionality. Each class in each project must include a constructor, getters and setters, private properties, and methods for GetAll() and ClearAll()._
